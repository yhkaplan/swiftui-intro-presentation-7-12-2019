# [fit] What is it?

# [fit] Why is it?

---

# [fit] 4 Core Principles

---

# Declarative 

- describe the result

---

# Automatic functionality 

- Sane defaults
- Built in accessability, dark mode, localizability, spacing/insets

---

# Compositional

- Small components make up bigger UI

---

# Simple state management

---

# [fit] What I like

- Less code
- Easier state management
- Realtime preview
- Code is the single source of truth
- Apple controls the whole stack:
    - chips -> device -> language -> OS -> SDK
- Works with UIKit

---

# [fit] What I don't like

- More View types: CollectionView,etc
- Errors are complex
- Data flow is not truly one-way
- Not OSS/Poor documentation
- iOS 13 and up only
- I feel old üë®‚Äçü¶≥

# [fit] Demo

# [fit] Data flow

---

# @State 

* locally owned by view and requires initial default value
* Value type
* Use should be limited because State data is owned by view, while putting it in model is preferable 
* Something that controls what is currently visible (on off switch) seems like ideal use

---

```swift
struct PlayerView : View {
  let episode: Episode
  @State private var isPlaying: Bool = false

  var body: some View {
    VStack {
      Text(episode.title)
      Text(episode.showTitle).font(.caption).foregroundColor(.gray)
      Button(action: {
        self.isPlaying.toggle()
      }) {
        Image(systemName: isPlaying ? "pause.circle" : "play.circle")
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

# @Binding 
* not owned and does not require initial default
* Set by `$propertyName` and passed to child view that owns it as a @State
* Read and write

---

```swift
struct PlayButton : View {
  @Binding var isPlaying: Bool

  var body: some View {
    Button(action: {
      self.isPlaying.toggle()
    }) {
      Image(systemName: isPlaying ? "pause.circle" : "play.circle")
    }
  }
}
```

---

# BindableObject 
* data external to the View (stuff other than touch events, etc)
* Good for existing model integration 
    * use RepresentableContext for sharing w/ UIView/VCs
* Comform store for example to BindableObject protocol `didChange`
* Use `@ObjectBinding` property wrapper
* Reference
* Add Combine Publisher to use

---

```swift
struct MyView : View {
  @ObjectBinding var model: MyModelObject
  ...
}
MyView(model: modelInstance)
```

---

# `@EnvironmentObject`
* Widely shared data like theme etc

---

```swift
struct PlayerView : View {
  @EnvironmentObject var player: PodcastPlayerStore

  var body: some View {
    VStack {
      Text(player.currentEpisode.title)
        .foregroundColor(isPlaying ? .white : .gray)
      Text(player.currentEpisode.showTitle)
        .font(.caption).foregroundColor(.gray)

      PlayButton(isPlaying: $player.isPlaying)
      Text("\(player.currentTime, formatter: playheadTimeFormatter)")
    }
  }
} 
```
